# Caesar Cipher Tool

### Context:
This is my first cryptography related program. While doing research on different types of ciphers, I thought it would be awesome to write a program that could encode and decode with a variety of ciphers. It would also provide a learning opportunity for me to learn the ins and outs of how to implement a wide variety of cryptographic ciphers. I ended up setting on just implementing the Caesar cipher for now, although I would like to expand the tool to include different ciphers in the future. This program is actually presently in need of some rewriting and optimization. I wrote this program while sleep deprived, thus it has a couple of minor errors that need to be fixed. The program does work for the most part though.

### Concept:
Caesar Cipher Tool can encode or decode messages using the Caesar cipher. The user is able to choose how many positions of the alphabet they would like their message to be shifted. This program has two modes, "Encode", and "Decode". "Encode" is simple a shift to the right (A ---> Z), while "Decode" is a shift to the left (A <--- Z).
